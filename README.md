## GoChamp Fitness App
At Engenious, I worked as the Lead Frontend Engineer for a white-label fitness product. I architected the frontend in collaboration with a backend engineer to integrate a custom backend and payment system. The product serves as a user onboarding, profile management and data collection funnel, with a key objective of avoiding high payment processing fees from the Google and Apple app stores.
The project was built using React and TypeScript, and includes the following core features:
- Multi-step onboarding form
- BMI calculator
- Authorization via email and social logins
- Subscription payments with Stripe
- User profile management
- Google Analytics integration
