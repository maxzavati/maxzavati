## 👋 Hi, I'm Max
Specialist in engineering scalable, high-performance frontend web applications with a focus on robust architecture. While I have expertise in TypeScript and React, I am a technology-agnostic problem solver who prioritizes architectural patterns over specific frameworks. From building modular component libraries to designing AI-driven workflows and CMS integrations, I lead projects from concept to production. With experience in the Payments and Healthcare sectors, I ensure technical decisions satisfy both strict regulatory requirements and high-end UI/UX standards. I focus on mentoring teams to build systems that remain maintainable long after the initial deployment.
